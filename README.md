Layoffs have been on the rise in recent months as companies brace for a potential economic downturn. High inflation, rising interest rates, and fears of recession have led many firms to cut costs through hiring freezes, payroll reductions, and staff layoffs. Industries facing slowing demand, like technology, real estate, and finance have seen some of the biggest waves of layoffs. Even the historically stable healthcare industry has not been immune. While the labor market remains tight overall, prolonged economic uncertainty could mean more widespread job cuts across sectors. For laid-off workers, a still-strong employment market provides options to find new roles, but hiring may slow if macroeconomic headwinds persist. Some of the layoffs aim to cut lower priority roles in areas like marketing, support, and back-office jobs, but even core product and engineering teams have not avoided the axe. The full extent of layoffs and their impact on local job markets remains uncertain, but signals point to an economy under strain.

In this project, I have used a dataset obtained from Kaggle to analyse the layoffs scenario in today's market. I have used several metrics to build charts to demonstrate topics like: Top 10 companies with highest number of Layoffs, Industry wise count of layoffs, count of layoffs in each country, etc.

Future work: I am planning to include some more attributes to the dataset to visualize more about the layoffs scenario and get many more insights for a better understanding of the factors forcing companies to fire people and the consequences of these layoffs.
